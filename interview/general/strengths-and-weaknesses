Strengths: 
1. eager to learn, love to hack things, result oriented, able to solve problem.
For example, I studied a lot and got the AWS solution architect certification. Because I want to know how to design a cloud architecture and how to use cloud service to solve real world problems.
When I encounter diffcult problem. I will try my best to solve it. for exmaple, their are some code are not efficiency. I will read some doc, or blog find the optimized way to do. 

2. ownership, good team worker
I am familiar with the technique ( versioning control git ). I will be the volunteer to share my experience of the technique with the teams. demonstrate the technique to the teams and help other team merber.

3. I am able to Disagree and commit
When I found that things are going on different way, I will share my idea, wanna to know why things are going on that way and the benefit. I would like to learn something new from different approach to things.

Weaknesses: 
1. rush
When I'm working on a project, I don't just want to meet deadlines. Rather, I prefer to complete the project well ahead of its due date. While this means I never miss a deadline, it also means that sometimes I can find myself rushed when I’m working. I’ve since learned to slow down, be more patient, and give each project the careful attention it deserves.

2. nerves
Biggest weakness: not that confident to give a presentations
I was asked to give a presentation. Although I am preparing well, I'm still nervous. I am still tring to deal with that, I watch some ted talk, some public speech and learn from that.

3. not a native english speaker
sometime I cant express my self very well in english. I am working hard on this, listen to podcast, english youtube channel, movie, netflix etc.
