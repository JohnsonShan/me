Strengths: 
1. eager to learn, love to hack things, love to solve challenging problem.
When I encounter diffcult problem. I will try my best to solve it. 
For example, project need aws, challenging problem, never use it before, know not much about aws, I studied a lot, read doc, blog, follow tutorial
R: familar with aws, have big contribute to the project, moreover passed exam and got the AWS solution architect associate certification.

2. ownership, good team worker
love to work with a team. ppl have different strengths knowledge, can share experience, can help each other
I am familiar with the tool ( versioning control git ). I stand out share my experience knowledge with the teams. demonstrate the tool to the teams and help other team merber.


Weaknesses: 
1. have lack experience to lead a project
I have 2 and half years exp as a swe, i have many achievement as a team member. i did have some time in charge of some small project, is a good experience. learn to deal with diff ppl, make godd dicision. but i want more. i hope will have chance to lead a large scale project.  

2. result orientated person, more attension on detail. 
I can finish tasks very fast, then move on to anther. i focus on delivery results, fullfill the requirement. but no enough, i want to give more attension, and give a answer above or beyond the requirement. I spend time to review my solution regularly, try to improve the solution, after a long time, is much better, try to write most optimize code for every task. fullfill more than requirement.


3. Biggest weakness: not that confident to give a presentations
I was asked to give a presentation. Although I am preparing well, I'm still nervous. I am still tring to deal with that, I watch some ted talk, some public speech and learn from that.

4. not a native english speaker
sometime I cant express my self very well in english. I am working hard on this, listen to podcast, english youtube channel, movie, netflix etc.
