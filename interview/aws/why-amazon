how amazon impacted positively on your life

Amazon is a great company. Amazon has impacted people worldwide including me. Amazon provides new options to buy stuff. It is a leading company in the industry. Amazon carry on to obsess the customers, develop and deliver new products and services to customers. 
And AWS, make development much easier, people focus to build their product and no worry about the infrastructure. I canâ€™t think of many other companies that start with the customer and then work backwards.

leadership principles

Another reason I want to work at Amazon is because of the Leadership Principles.
I studied the 16 leadership principles. And I can see that those principles lead Amazon to success. For me, my favorite is OwnerShip. It tells us to be brave, to take responsibility and accept challenges. Amazon will be an exciting place to work. I will get to be innovative, creative, pushed and challenged to be the best I can be.
That's why I want to work at Amazon.
